\section{Framework}

Response surface methodology~\cite{box51response,carley04response}, also known as metamodel-based methods~\cite{barton06metamodel} for stochastic simulations is generally used for optimization~\cite{neddermeijer00response} and calibration~\cite{fadikar17emulation, lamperti18calibration}.
