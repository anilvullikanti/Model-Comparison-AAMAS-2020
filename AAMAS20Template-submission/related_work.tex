\section{Related Work}
Earlier researchers have considered comparison of models and simulations to increase confidence in results and in interpretation of the models, e.g.~\cite{xu2003docking, axtell96aligning, burton99validation}. Work by~\cite{xu2003docking} compares RePast~\cite{collier2003repast} and Swarm~\cite{minar1996swarm} based simulations of four different social network models, i.e. random graphs, preferential attachment, and preference attachment with constant fitness, and with dynamic fitness. Structural properties of these networks were used to dock RePast and Swarm simulations. The results showed that docking could help validate a simulation and help migrate a simulation from one software package to another. Authors in~\cite{north2002beer} used Mathematica, Swarm and RePast to simulate a Beer distribution game. Louie et al.~\cite{louie2003model} show how model comparison and model alignment can help compare and contrast models, clarify assumptions and understand semantic differences in data usage.
