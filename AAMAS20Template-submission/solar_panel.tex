\section{Rooftop Solar Panel Adoption}
\label{section:rooftop}
We compare two ABMs for rooftop solar adoption, one built by Zhang et al. for San Diego, California~\cite{zhang16solar} and the other for Shenandoah Valley region in Virginia, as described below in Section~\ref{sec:virginia_model}. They both use a set of demographic, social, economic and geographical variables to assess the probability of adoption for each household in respective study areas. A logistic regression model is built in each case to identify important factors that influence solar adoption. These factors are then used by their respective ABMs to study the diffusion of adoption. Since the solar penetration rate in Virginia is much smaller compared to California, a decision-adjusted logistic regression model was used to handle the issue of class imbalance in Virginia.
