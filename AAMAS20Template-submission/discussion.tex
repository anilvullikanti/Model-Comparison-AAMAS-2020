\section{Discussion}

The method is extendable to any classifier. We tried Random forest and SVM linear kernel.
We propose two strategies for choosing points close to or on the decision boundary but far away from the $boundaryPoints$ and $evaluatedPoints$ in the search space. Neighbor points and svm line equation.

How many points is enough points to learn the boundary? Do we have an explainable heuristic?

Do we have any metric to show that?

Do we reduce the number of runs of the diffusion model to learn the decision boundary?


Initially the classifier can be highly vulnerable to biases because of limited data. -- how do we overcome that or do we face that problem?
